    "text": "Education\n\nMaster’s of Public Health\nCase Western Reserve University, School of Medicine Cleveland, OH\nMaster’s of Public Health (MPH)\nConcentrations in Population Health Sciences and Health Promotion & Disease Prevention\n4.00 GPA\n2023 - 2025\n\n\nBachelor’s of Arts\nCase Western Reserve University Cleveland, OH\nBA in Public Health and Medical Anthropology, Minor in Bioethics\n3.96 GPA, Dean’s Honors List\n2020 - 2025\n\n\nMotivations\nI’ve been asked, more than once, about how my passion for public health developed and how I know, with certainty, that I want to pursue this field of study as a career. My interest began at a young age. In my 7th-grade science class, we spent several class periods playing Plague Inc, a game with the goal of creating a pathogen that could infect and then wipe out humanity while fighting off scientists’ best efforts to neutralize it. Intrigued that something small and invisible can negatively affect the world and how the role of scientists can positively impact it, I played the game for weeks after the class moved on to other topics.\nIn high school, I considered becoming a physician and shadowed a general practitioner for several months. Experiencing the one-on-one interaction between doctor and patient was meaningful and educational, but I felt that I could affect greater change through a broader approach. This yearning for a more impactful career was solidified when I took a university seminar discussing the history of the U.S. AIDS crisis from different perspectives and disciplines, highlighting the complexities of managing public health crises. It was this seminar that inspired me to explore public health as a career. However, as CWRU only has a minor public health program and not a formal major, I brought my concerns to my academic advisor. He recommended that I major in another field of study, settle on a public health minor, and pursue it further in graduate school. Instead, I took the initiative to create a Dean’s Approved Major. This meant finding two academic advisors to support me, creating a course list by researching programs at other institutions, and submitting a proposal to create a major, which would then need to be reviewed and approved by a panel of professionals at CWRU. I am grateful for the support from the professors who became my academic advisors and proud of my comprehensive course list, comparable to other top universities with public health programs. I am especially appreciative to have the opportunity to study what I am truly passionate about at a top U.S. university.\nMore recently, my passion for public health has grown after studying and researching the diversity of its approaches and disciplinary perspectives. Obtaining an MPH degree will help me dive deeply into the study of Population Health Research and Health Promotion & Disease Prevention. I aspire to be a well-rounded public health professional by utilizing a mixed-methods approach. In general, using an interdisciplinary and mixed-methods approach creates a more balanced and holistic study of public health. And while I am still forging my pathway to my career, my main motivations stay true: my ambition to improve health outcomes whether that’s by improving quality of life, symptom management, preventing conditions, or even curing a condition."

    "text": "As someone who is early on in their career as a scientist, I found many aspects of How to Be a Modern Scientist by Jeff Leek to be helpful. The book provides practical insights into how researchers can flourish in today’s scientific environment. One key insight that I resonated with was from the “Paper Writing” chapter in which Leek makes the following statement: “Write clearly and simply even though it may make your papers harder to publish.” In this section, Leek describes how although it may make publishing your paper more difficult, doing so allows for wider communication of the study. He goes on further to describe that the point of publishing is to increase the accessibility of the study. This is something I feel very strongly about, as accessibility to published research is an important issue in academia. Articles containing jargon can be very difficult for readers outside of the field or academia to understand. In some occasions, results can be misinterpreted and disseminated (by the media, for example), leading to misinformation, making this a critical issue. Thus, I agree with Leek in making papers clear and simple to understand to increase accessibility.\nAnother insight that caught my attention was Leek’s discussion of collaboration in science. In his chapter “Social Media in Science,” he explains how modern scientists can build strong professional relationships and networks through social media and conferences, for example. He encourages scientists to use platforms such as Twitter and FaceBook for scientific collaboration by sharing their own work, widening their audience, or simply making connections in scientific communities. He even provides helpful tips in order to achieve this, such as not needing to develop original content but rather providing brief commentary and ideas. I found this to be quite a fascinating insight as I had never personally considered using social media for this purpose, even though I grew up in the era of social media.\nThe final idea that piqued my interest was the “Career Planning” chapter, as I am currently job-searching for my first postgraduate career. In this chapter, Leek provides guidance for science graduates and postdocs, encouraging them to create a career plan and providing tips and tricks for doing so in order to make sense of the challenges and opportunities that may arise. His first question to the reader is to consider what they want to do–-whether they want to be a tenured track faculty/PI at a research or liberal arts school, be a research track faculty, or work in industry. He then provides tools that aid with the process in the form of a worksheet asking questions and mentioning topics such as what’s your goal, who are you, networking, etc. I found this to be a refreshing take on the job search discussion. Oftentimes, it feels like there may be a right or wrong way to do things, but Leek’s discussion is framed based on your goals, skills, and vision for yourself. I have already found this chapter to be quite useful for me while on my job search, and I am continuing to use these tools as I progress through it."

    "section": "A World Beyond p < 0.05: Important Insights from The American Statistician",
    "text": "A World Beyond p &lt; 0.05: Important Insights from The American Statistician\nWhen I first read this article, it changed my outlook on statistics. In High School and even some classes in my undergraduate career, I was taught to designate findings as “statistically significant” solely based on low p-values, without the mention of other important aspects. For many years, I followed this strategy without question. However, in graduate school, I took a Statistical Methods course that first introduced me to not only this article but also this topic, and it has changed the way I approach, think, and write about statistics. This article from the American Statistician implores us not to use p-values as an end-all or be-all for determining whether an association or effect exists, as well as abandon the term “statistically significant” (or any alternative phrase, i.e., significantly different). The explanation is that using p &lt; 0.05 and the notion of statistical significance as a basis for whether an association or effect is meaningful is quite flawed. Essentially, we are using an arbitrary threshold (typically p &gt; 0.05 or p &gt; 0.001) to determine whether an association is present vs. absent, whether hypotheses can be accepted or rejected, and the importance of results. I found this quote to be particularly persuasive: “Regardless of whether it was ever useful, a declaration of “statistical significance” has today become meaningless… [The] original intention for statistical significance was simply as a tool to indicate when a result warrants further scrutiny. But that idea has been irretrievably lost. Statistical significance was never meant to imply scientific importance, and the confusion of the two was decried soon after its widespread use.” Essentially, when we internalize and practice the idea of statistical significance, we view p = 0.052 and p = 0.048 as categorically different, which is a problem. Instead, the article recommends to use this acronym when interpreting statistical results: ATOM. This stands for Accept uncertainty, Be thoughtful, Open, and Modest.\nAfter reading this article, I no longer use the phrase “statically significant” and categorize my findings solely based on whether or not the p-values cross an arbitrary threshold. Since making this change, I’ve noticed just how prevalent the phrase and idea of statistical significance is in my other statistics classes, articles, etc. I implore those still using the notion of statistical significance to not only abandon the phrase, but read this article in full, in order to fully understand the complexities of the problem"
